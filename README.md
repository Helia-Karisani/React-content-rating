# React Content Rating 👍👎

This project is a React application that allows users to rate content using "Like" and "Dislike" buttons. It demonstrates dynamic state handling, class-based components, and real-time UI updates in response to user interaction.

## 🧠 What I Did

- Cloned and adapted the IBM boilerplate for content rating.
- Built a class-based `ContentRating` component located in  
  [`src/Components/ContentRating.jsx`](src/Components/ContentRating.jsx)
- Styled the component using [`ContentRating.css`](src/Components/ContentRating.css)
- Integrated the component into the app via [`App.jsx`](src/App.jsx)

## ✅ Key Features

- Displays custom content that users can rate
- Handles button click events using arrow functions inside the component state
- Dynamically updates the count of:
  - Likes 👍
  - Dislikes 👎
  - Total Ratings 📊
- Uses `setState` to reflect real-time feedback in the UI
